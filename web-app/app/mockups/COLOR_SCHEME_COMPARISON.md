## Technical Implementation

### CSS Variable Structure
Each scheme can be implemented with a simple root variable swap:

```css
/* Sophisticated Neutral */
:root {
  --color-primary-bg: #F4D9C6;    /* Pale Peach */
  --color-secondary-bg: #F5E6D3;  /* Cream */
  --color-card-bg: #A8896D;       /* Warm Taupe */
  --color-accent: #D4A59A;        /* Dusty Pink (sparingly!) */
  --color-text-primary: #3A2F27;  /* Dark Brown */
  --color-border: #8B6F61;        /* Medium Brown */
  --color-cta: #2F5D50;           /* Bottle Green */
}
```

Switching schemes requires only swapping the root variable values.

## Conclusion

All 4 schemes successfully address the pink-dominance concern while maintaining the Wes Anderson aesthetic. The recommended approach:

1. **Default to Sophisticated Neutral** for broadest appeal
2. **A/B test against Coastal Archive** if male early adopters are primary concern
3. **Avoid Forest Study** unless targeting very traditional/academic niche
4. **Consider Earthy Sage** as a middle ground if testing shows preference for color over neutrality

The key insight: **Dusty Pink works beautifully as an accent** across all schemes, providing warmth and personality without dominating the interface.
