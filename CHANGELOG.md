### Changed
- **Entity Resolution Protocol** - Enhanced with phonetic name matching
  - Weighted combination of lexical (Levenshtein 70%) + phonetic (Double Metaphone 30%)
  - Provisional canonical IDs now use `PROV:` prefix format
  - Dual-key blocking checks both `wikidata_id` and `canonical_id`
- **MediaWork Ingestion Protocol** - Now documented inline in API routes
  - Step-by-step protocol compliance comments in `/api/media/create`
- **Authentication** - NextAuth configuration extracted to separate module
  - Fixed Route export validation errors

### Fixed
- **CHR-13: Critical form reset bug** - Fixed `setSentiment` reference to non-existent function

### Security
