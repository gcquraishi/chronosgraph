## Metrics

### Commits & Code Changes
- **Commits:** 20 commits over 13 days
- **Files Changed:** 64 files
- **Lines Added:** +4,251 lines
- **Lines Removed:** -315 lines
- **Net Impact:** +3,936 lines of production code

### Features Delivered
- **Complete Features:** 12 roadmap sessions (1.1.1-1.1.4, 1.2.1-1.2.4, 1.3.1-1.3.3)
- **Design System:** 7 phases complete
- **New Components:** 18 new components (3 UI primitives, 1 landing component, 14 mockups)
- **API Endpoints:** 2 new endpoints (universal search, test-db)

### Quality Metrics
- **TypeScript Errors:** 0 (all fixed)
- **Build Status:** Passing
- **Test Coverage:** Manual testing completed for all navigation flows

## Highlights

### Major Achievements
1. **Visual Identity Established** - Evidence Locker design system gives Fictotum a distinctive, cohesive look
2. **Navigation Infrastructure Complete** - Navbar, search, and pathfinding form solid foundation
3. **Phase 1 Milestone** - 100% of Core UX Polish sessions delivered on time
4. **Zero Technical Debt** - No TypeScript errors, build passing, no known bugs

### Breakthrough Moments
- Discovery that "bureaucratic dossier" aesthetic (stone/amber, monospace) perfectly fits historical data platform
- Path highlighting integration between landing page query and graph explorer
- Successful consolidation of 7 search categories into single unified endpoint

## Challenges

### Solved During Sprint
1. **TypeScript Import Errors** - Fixed double-metaphone import and wikidata enrich route
2. **Duplicate Key Errors** - Resolved in API routes
3. **Color Consistency** - Required Phase 6 sweep to align all components with Evidence Locker palette
4. **Design Exploration** - 14 mockup variations before settling on final Evidence Locker Light aesthetic

### Deferred
- Phase 2 (Data Quality & Provenance) not started
- Multi-agent coordination hasn't been needed (single designer + frontend specialist working sequentially)

## Sprint Velocity

**Planned Sessions:** 12 (Phase 1.1-1.3)
**Delivered Sessions:** 12 + 7 design phases (158% delivery)
**Sprint Length:** 13 days
**Velocity:** ~1.5 sessions per day (including design system work)

## Next Sprint Preview

Based on accomplishments, recommended priorities:

### Option A: Phase 2 (Data Quality & Provenance)
- Track data provenance with CREATED_BY relationships
- Build trust and accountability into knowledge graph

### Option B: Content Growth Sprint
- Ingest more historical figures and media works
- Focus on high-value data sets (Roman history, WWII figures, etc.)
- Build critical mass for network effects

### Option C: Graph Exploration Polish (Phase 3)
- Breadcrumb trails
- Forward navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts
- More intuitive deep exploration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Celebrate Phase 1 Completion** - This is a significant milestone worth acknowledging
2. **Document Agent Roles** - No formal agent assignment or coordination needed this sprint; consider if that changes
3. **Choose Next Phase** - CEO decision needed: Data Quality (Phase 2) vs Content Growth vs Graph Polish (Phase 3)

### Process Improvements
- Consider creating quarterly roadmaps for each agent role
- Establish sprint length (2 weeks recommended)
- Create dependency map if multiple agents work in parallel

### Technical Debt
- **None identified** - Clean slate going into next sprint

## CEO Decision Points

**Critical Decisions Needed:**
1. **Next Phase Priority** - Which phase should we tackle next?
   - Phase 2 (Data Quality) - Best for long-term data integrity
   - Content Growth - Best for user value and network effects
   - Phase 3 (Graph Polish) - Best for exploration UX

2. **Sprint Cadence** - Formalize 2-week sprint cycle?

3. **Agent Coordination** - Should we assign specific agents to upcoming work, or continue ad-hoc assignment?
