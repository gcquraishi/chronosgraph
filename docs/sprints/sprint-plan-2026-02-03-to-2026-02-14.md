# Sprint Plan: February 3 - February 14, 2026

## Sprint Goal
Establish data provenance tracking and begin content growth to achieve critical mass for network effects.

## Strategic Context

**Why This Sprint:**
- Phase 1 (UX Polish) delivered a polished, production-ready interface
- Now need high-quality content to showcase the platform's value
- Data provenance (CREATED_BY) enables future multi-user contributions
- Building toward public launch requires both quality data AND audit trails

**Success Criteria:**
- CREATED_BY relationships implemented and backfilled for existing data
- 50+ new historical figures added with proper entity resolution
- 20+ new media works added with Wikidata integration
- All new contributions properly attributed to agents

## Committed Work

### Research Analyst (Data Ingestion Lead)
**Focus:** Content Growth - Historical Figure Ingestion

- [ ] Identify 3 high-value data sources for Roman history figures (Medium)
  - Target: 50-75 new figures with existing media portrayals
  - Prioritize figures with strong interconnections
  - Validate Wikidata Q-IDs exist before ingestion
- [ ] Ingest 50+ Roman historical figures (Large)
  - Use `/contribute` unified hub
  - Follow MediaWork Ingestion Protocol (Wikidata Q-ID first)
  - Apply Entity Resolution Protocol (canonical_id strategy)
  - Document ingestion decisions in session notes
- [ ] Create 30+ appearance relationships (Medium)
  - Connect newly added figures to existing/new media works
  - Include sentiment tags (heroic/villainous/complex)
  - Ensure actor_name populated where known

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours across sprint

### Data Architect (Schema & Backend Lead)
**Focus:** Phase 2.1 - CREATED_BY Relationship Implementation

- [ ] Design Agent node schema and CREATED_BY relationship (Small)
  - Define Agent properties (name, type, version, created_at)
  - Design CREATED_BY relationship properties (timestamp, context)
  - Update `scripts/schema.py` with new node type
- [ ] Create migration script to backfill CREATED_BY for existing data (Medium)
  - Parse CHRONOS_LOG.md and git history for attribution
  - Write Cypher to add Agent nodes and relationships
  - Include dry-run mode for safety
  - Document migration process
- [ ] Update contribution APIs to set CREATED_BY on new nodes (Medium)
  - Modify `/api/figures/create`
  - Modify `/api/media/create`
  - Modify `/api/contribution/appearance`
  - Add agent context to API calls (detect if human vs agent)
- [ ] Create audit query endpoint (Small)
  - `/api/audit/node-provenance?nodeId={id}`
  - Returns CREATED_BY chain and timestamps
  - Useful for debugging and future multi-user features

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours across sprint

### Technical Writer (Documentation Lead)
**Focus:** Knowledge Base & Process Documentation

- [ ] Document entity resolution workflow (Small)
  - Create visual flowchart for canonical_id strategy
  - Explain when to use Wikidata Q-ID vs PROV: prefix
  - Include examples of phonetic matching edge cases
- [ ] Create data ingestion guide for future agents (Medium)
  - Step-by-step tutorial using `/contribute` hub
  - MediaWork protocol compliance checklist
  - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
  - Wikidata Q-ID lookup best practices
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with Phase 2 protocols (Small)
  - Add CREATED_BY relationship requirements
  - Document Agent node creation
  - Update safety guidelines for data attribution

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours across sprint

### DevOps Engineer (Infrastructure & Testing Lead)
**Focus:** Database Health & Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Create Neo4j health check script (Small)
  - Verify connection, check node counts, detect orphaned nodes
  - Add to `/scripts/qa/neo4j_health_check.py`
  - Schedule weekly runs (manual for now)
- [ ] Add entity resolution test suite (Medium)
  - Unit tests for `enhancedNameSimilarity()` function
  - Integration tests for duplicate detection
  - Edge case testing (Unicode names, titles with punctuation)
  - Add to `/scripts/qa/test_entity_resolution.py`
- [ ] Monitor database growth during ingestion (Small)
  - Track node counts, relationship counts
  - Document in `docs/reports/database-growth-feb-2026.md`
  - Alert if duplicate figures detected

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours across sprint

## Dependencies & Coordination

### Critical Path
1. **Day 1-2:** Data Architect designs Agent schema → unblocks migration work
2. **Day 3-5:** Data Architect runs migration → establishes baseline for provenance
3. **Day 6-10:** Research Analyst ingests figures → validates CREATED_BY implementation
4. **Day 11-14:** Technical Writer documents → captures learnings while fresh

### Handoff Protocols
- **Data Architect → Research Analyst:** After migration completes, post summary in STATUS_BOARD.md
- **Research Analyst → Technical Writer:** After ingesting 25+ figures, share session notes for documentation
- **DevOps Engineer → Data Architect:** After health check script ready, run baseline audit

### Shared Resources
- **Neo4j Database:** Primary resource claimed by all agents
  - Research Analyst: Write access for ingestion (no locks needed, append-only)
  - Data Architect: Write access for migration (coordinate timing via STATUS_BOARD.md)
  - DevOps Engineer: Read access for monitoring (no conflicts)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Migration Script Breaks Existing Data
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Mandatory dry-run testing on backup database
- Data Architect creates database snapshot before migration
- CEO reviews migration output before production run

### Risk 2: Research Analyst Creates Duplicates During Ingestion
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- DevOps Engineer's monitoring script will detect duplicates
- Entity resolution protocol explicitly requires Wikidata Q-ID check first
- Technical Writer documents common pitfalls in real-time

### Risk 3: Sprint Scope Too Ambitious
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- 50+ figures is stretch goal; 30+ figures is minimum viable
- CREATED_BY implementation is highest priority (Phase 2.1)
- Documentation can extend into next sprint if needed

## Clarifying Questions for CEO

1. **Priority Trade-off:** If we must choose, prioritize CREATED_BY implementation (data quality) or content growth (user value)?
   - **Recommendation:** CREATED_BY first (3 days), then content growth (7 days)

2. **Roman History Focus:** Confirm Roman history is the right content vertical?
   - **Alternative:** WWII figures, Medieval Europe, or Ancient Egypt

3. **Agent Coordination:** Should agents post daily updates in STATUS_BOARD.md?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, brief daily check-ins to surface blockers early

4. **Content Quality Bar:** What's minimum acceptable metadata for new figures?
   - **Recommendation:** Wikidata Q-ID (required), birth year (required), era tags (required)

## Definition of Done

Sprint complete when:
- [ ] All committed tasks completed or explicitly deprioritized
- [ ] CREATED_BY relationships exist on 100% of nodes in database
- [ ] 30+ new historical figures added (stretch: 50+)
- [ ] 15+ new media works added (stretch: 20+)
- [ ] Entity resolution documentation published
- [ ] Database health check script running successfully
- [ ] STATUS_BOARD.md updated with session summaries
- [ ] Sprint review document created
- [ ] Any blockers escalated and resolved
- [ ] Next sprint (Feb 17 - Feb 28) planned
