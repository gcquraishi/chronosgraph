# ChronosGraph Autonomous Workflow System

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-18
**Owner:** Sprint Coordinator Agent

---

## Overview

This document defines how the ChronosGraph agent ecosystem operates as an autonomous product development organization. Each agent develops quarterly roadmaps, breaks work into 2-week sprints, coordinates with other agents, and presents plans to the CEO for greenlight rather than prompting-from-scratch execution.

## Organizational Structure

---

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

Agents must proactively ask clarifying questions to ensure they solve the right problems.

### When to Ask Questions

**Before Starting Work:**
- Scope ambiguity ("Should this include X or just Y?")
- Priority conflicts ("Feature A or Bug B first?")
- Resource questions ("Can I use external API Z?")
- User intent ("Who is the primary user for this feature?")

**During Work:**
- Discovered complexity ("This is bigger than estimated - should I descope?")
- Design decisions ("Option A is faster, Option B is more flexible - which matters more?")
- Blockers ("I need X from Agent Y - what's the timeline?")

### Question Format

```markdown
## Clarifying Question: [Brief Title]

**Context:** [1-2 sentences explaining the situation]

**Question:** [Specific question]

**Options:**
- **A:** [Option description] - *Pros:* [list] | *Cons:* [list]
- **B:** [Option description] - *Pros:* [list] | *Cons:* [list]

**My Recommendation:** [Option] because [rationale]

**Blocking?:** [Yes - need answer before proceeding / No - can continue with assumption]
```

### Question Response Protocol
1. Questions compiled in sprint plan under "Clarifying Questions for CEO"
2. CEO reviews and answers during greenlight process
3. Sprint Coordinator distributes answers to relevant agents
4. Blocking questions must be resolved before sprint starts
5. Non-blocking questions can be answered async during sprint

---

## Cross-Agent Coordination

### Visibility Requirements

**Each agent maintains awareness of:**
- Other agents' current sprint commitments
- Upstream dependencies they're waiting on
- Downstream agents waiting on their work

**Sprint Coordinator provides:**
- Unified sprint plan visible to all agents
- Dependency map showing who blocks whom
- Mid-sprint status updates

### Handoff Protocol

When Agent A completes work that Agent B depends on:

```markdown
## Handoff: [Task Name]
**From:** [Agent A]
**To:** [Agent B]
**Date:** [Completion date]

### What Was Delivered
[Description of the completed work]

### Where to Find It
- Files: [list of files created/modified]
- Commits: [relevant commit hashes]
- PRs: [if applicable]

### How to Use It
[Instructions for Agent B to pick up the work]

### Known Issues / Caveats
- [Any limitations or gotchas]
- [Suggested improvements for future]

### Suggested Next Steps
1. [What Agent B should do first]
2. [What Agent B should do next]

### Questions?
[How to reach Agent A for clarification]
```

### Conflict Resolution

**When agents have conflicting approaches:**

1. **Identify the conflict** - Sprint Coordinator or Chief of Staff surfaces it
2. **Document both positions** - Each agent explains their approach
3. **Evaluate trade-offs** - What does each approach optimize for?
4. **Escalate if needed** - CEO decides if no consensus
5. **Document the decision** - Record rationale for future reference

## CEO Ceremonies

The CEO (human operator) maintains lightweight oversight through defined checkpoints.

### Required Ceremonies

| Ceremony | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Quarterly Greenlight** | Quarterly | 30-60 min | Review and approve agent roadmaps |
| **Sprint Greenlight** | Bi-weekly | 15-30 min | Review and approve sprint plan |
| **Sprint Review** | Bi-weekly | 15-30 min | Review accomplishments, answer questions |

### Optional Ceremonies

| Ceremony | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Ad-hoc Decision** | Agent escalation | Resolve blocking questions |
| **Strategy Session** | Market change/opportunity | Adjust priorities mid-quarter |
| **Retrospective** | End of quarter | Process improvement |

### CEO Input Format

**Sprint Greenlight Response:**
```markdown
## Sprint [##] Greenlight

**Status:** [APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CHANGES / NEEDS REVISION]

### Approved As-Is
- [Agent]: [Their plan is good]

### Changes Requested
- [Agent]: [Specific change] - Reason: [why]

### Questions Answered
1. Q: [Question] A: [Answer]
2. Q: [Question] A: [Answer]

### Additional Priorities
- [If any new items should be added]

### Notes
[Any strategic context or guidance]
```

## Asynchronous Operation

Agents operate asynchronously with clear handoff protocols.

### Async Principles

1. **Document Everything** - Decisions, progress, and blockers go in CHRONOS_LOG.md
2. **Clear Handoffs** - Use handoff template when work moves between agents
3. **Proactive Communication** - Surface blockers before they become urgent
4. **Explicit Status** - Every task is clearly: Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Complete

### Communication Channels

| Type | Channel | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Work log** | CHRONOS_LOG.md | Session summaries, decisions, progress |
| **Sprint status** | Sprint plan doc | Current sprint progress, blockers |
| **Handoffs** | Handoff notes | When work moves between agents |
| **Escalations** | Clarifying questions | CEO input needed |

### Status Update Template

```markdown
## [Agent Name] Status Update - [Date]

### Completed Since Last Update
- [Task]: [Brief outcome]
- [Task]: [Brief outcome]

### Currently Working On
- [Task]: [Current state, ETA]

### Blocked On
- [Task]: Waiting for [Agent/CEO]: [What's needed]

### Next Up
- [Task]: Will start after [trigger]

### Risks/Concerns
- [Any emerging issues]
