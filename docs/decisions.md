# Strategic Decisions Log
- **2026-01-14:** Chose Neo4j AuraDB Free tier. Limits: 200k nodes.
- **2026-01-14:** Established `:HistoricalFigure` and `:MediaWork` schema.
- **2026-01-15:** Pivoted to Sonnet 4.5 for ingestion to maximize token longevity (5x cheaper than Opus).
- **2026-01-15:** Integrated Neo4j MCP for direct database visibility.
- **2026-01-15:** Adopted Wikidata Q-IDs as canonical identifiers for `:MediaWork` entity resolution.
- **2026-01-15:** Initialized Unified Ingestion Framework to consolidate era-specific scripts into a modular, JSON-driven system.
- **2026-01-15:** Retroactively applied is_fictional: true flag to existing narrative anchors (vorenus, pullo, bayek, gordianus) to distinguish dramatic inventions from historical figures.
- **2026-01-15:** Initialized GEMINI.md to codify terminal-based Architect-to-Executor protocols.- **2026-01-15:** Initialized GEMINI.md to codify co-CEO persona and non-sycophantic technical lead protocols.
- **2026-01-15:** Expanded dataset to include the Flavian Dynasty via the 'Didius Falco' series (7 works).
- **2026-01-15:** Expanded research into Early Church era, ingesting canonical and Gnostic gospels with associated characterization conflicts.
- **2026-01-16:** Ingested cinematic Biblical portrayals (Life of Brian, Ben-Hur, Risen, Passion of the Christ) and established the Pilate-Jesus connection.
- **2026-01-16:** Ingested Roman response media (The Robe, Quo Vadis) and established connections between Julio-Claudian emperors and early Church leaders.
- **2026-01-17:** Extended schema.py with ScholarlyWork and FictionalCharacter models for scholarly sourcing and character-level tracking. Added INTERACTED_WITH and HAS_SCHOLARLY_BASIS relationships. All constraints use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency.
- **2026-01-17:** Created ingest_global_scaffold.py for modular batch ingestion across multiple eras. Implements fetch_seed_data() placeholder, INTERACTED_WITH era-aware linking, HAS_SCHOLARLY_BASIS relationships, and Wikidata Q-ID validation per CLAUDE.md protocol. Error logging for Opus-Review enabled.
- **2026-01-17:** Created pathfinder.py module for Six Degrees of Historiography queries. Uses Neo4j shortestPath algorithm to traverse INTERACTED_WITH and APPEARS_IN relationships. Includes automatic bridge detection for FictionalCharacter and MediaWork nodes. Returns JSON-formatted paths with bridge highlights.
- **2026-01-17:** Created FigureDossier.tsx React component for web app. Features Consensus Radar (Recharts radar chart), Scholarly Review sidebar with linked sources, and Portrayal Cards with anachronism/conflict flag alerts. Updated TypeScript interfaces to support DetailedPortrayal and ScholarlyWork.
- **2026-01-17:** Created ConflictFeed.tsx landing page component with Collision Cards for side-by-side portrayal comparison and Six Degrees search bar. Added /api/pathfinder POST endpoint and database functions (getConflictingPortrayals, findShortestPath). Professional "Lead Historian" design: data-dense, clean layouts with minimal decoration.
- **2026-01-17:** Ingested Global MVP seed dataset: 10 high-collision eras, 10 historical figures, 10 media works (all Wikidata-mapped), 9 fictional characters, 10 relationships. Zero errors. First full-scale use of FictionalCharacter schema. Custom ingestion script with dynamic relationship handling and media type inference.
- **2026-01-17:** Ingested Global MVP Batch 2 (deduplicated): 36 historical figures, 2 media works, 5 fictional characters, 10 relationships. Automated Wikidata Q-ID deduplication removed 27 duplicates. Database now has 166 figures, 448 media, 14 characters across 10 eras. Notable additions: Yasuke (African Samurai), Zhuge Liang, Anne Bonny, Rockefeller, Lucky Luciano.
- **2026-01-17:** Ingested Global MVP Batch 3 (deduplicated): 20 historical figures, 12 media works, 9 fictional characters, 7 relationships. Zero duplicates found - perfect batch. Database now has 186 figures, 460 media, 23 characters. Focus areas: Late Republic Power Blocks (Pompey, Crassus, Cicero, Cato), Naval Supremacy (Master and Commander), Gilded Age Innovation (Edison vs Tesla). Major literary works added: I, Claudius; War and Peace; Gone with the Wind; Treasure Island; Hamilton musical.
