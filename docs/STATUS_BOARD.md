## How to Use This Board

### For Agents:
- **Before starting work:** Check for conflicts, add proposal if needed, update "Currently Active"
- **During work:** Update progress notes if session >30 minutes
- **After completing:** Move to "Ready for Review" + add session handoff note
- **Proposing new work:** Add to "Proposed Next Steps" with Impact/Effort/Alternative

### For CEO:
- **Quick status check:** Scan "Currently Active" (10 seconds)
- **Review completions:** Check "Ready for Review" (10 seconds)
- **Approve next work:** Review proposals, mark decision column (10-30 sec each)
- **Unblock agents:** Review "Blockers" section as needed

### Coordination:
