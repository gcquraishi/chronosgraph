# Fictotum Icon Design Brief for Gemini

## Project Overview

You are creating a custom icon library for **Fictotum**, a historical data visualization platform. The icons must embody a **Wes Anderson aesthetic**: geometric, symmetrical, vintage (1960s-70s), whimsical yet precise.

---

## Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Wes Anderson films (The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom, The French Dispatch)
- **Form**: Geometric shapes only (circles, rectangles, triangles, lines)
- **Stroke Weight**: 2-3px consistent throughout each icon
- **Symmetry**: Symmetrical when conceptually appropriate
- **Complexity**: Simple enough to read at 24px, detailed enough to be charming at 64px
- **Era**: Vintage 1960s-70s travel poster / scout badge / passport stamp aesthetic

### Technical Specifications
- **Format**: SVG (inline, no external dependencies)
- **Size**: Design at 64px × 64px artboard
- **Colors**: Use 2-3 colors maximum per icon from the palette below
- **Line Style**: Clean, geometric, no gradients
- **Background**: Transparent

---

## Color Palette (CORRECTED)

Use these colors strategically across the icon library. Each icon should use 2-3 colors from this palette.

### Primary Colors
| Color Name | Hex Code | Visual Description |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Dusty Pink** | `#D4A59A` | Muted rose, terra cotta undertones |
| **Pale Peach** | `#F4D9C6` | Soft peachy cream (NOT yellow) |
| **Sage Green** | `#A8C9A8` | Muted mint green, gentle |
| **Dusty Coral** | `#E8C5B5` | Pale peachy tan (NOT blue) |

### Secondary Colors
| Color Name | Hex Code | Visual Description |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Mid-Blue** | `#5B9AA9` | Teal-blue, calm and professional |
| **Bottle Green** | `#2F5D50` | Deep forest green, sophisticated |
| **Muted Red** | `#C97676` | Terracotta red, vintage |
| **Warm Taupe** | `#A8896D` | Mushroom brown, earthy |

### Structural Colors
| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **Dark Brown** | `#3A2F27` | Outlines, primary strokes |
| **Medium Brown** | `#5C4A3C` | Secondary details |
| **Cream** | `#F5E6D3` | Fill colors, highlights |

**Color Distribution Strategy**: Vary which colors you use across icons to create visual diversity while maintaining cohesion.

## Composition Guidelines

### Icon-Specific Instructions

**For Each Variation:**
1. Use 2-3 colors from the provided palette (vary color choices across variations)
2. Maintain 2-3px stroke weight consistently
3. Design at 64px × 64px with 8px internal padding
4. Ensure icon reads clearly at 24px (test scalability)
5. Add small delightful details (vintage flourishes, subtle patterns) without compromising clarity

**Variation Strategy:**
- Each of the 5 variations should explore a **different conceptual approach**, not just minor style tweaks
- Think: "What are 5 completely different ways to visually represent this concept?"
- Vary: perspective (front/side/top), abstraction level (literal/symbolic), composition (centered/off-center), era references (1920s/1960s/1970s)

---

## Wes Anderson Reference Examples

### Visual Inspiration
- **Moonrise Kingdom**: Scout badges, hand-drawn maps, vintage camping equipment
- **The Grand Budapest Hotel**: Concierge keys, ornate frames, symmetrical hotel facades
- **The French Dispatch**: Magazine layouts, illustrated typographic elements, vintage printing
- **Fantastic Mr. Fox**: Whimsical animal portraits, autumnal color palette, puppet-like quality

### Design Patterns to Emulate
- Symmetrical compositions (centered, balanced)
- Vintage ephemera (stamps, labels, badges, tickets)
- Geometric simplicity (circles, rectangles, clean lines)
- Muted pastel colors with strategic accent colors
- Hand-crafted feel (not corporate, not tech-y)
- Nostalgic warmth (1960s-70s analog aesthetic)

---

## Deliverable Format

For each icon type, provide **5 complete SVG code blocks** labeled clearly:

```
### [Icon Name] - Variation A: [Brief Description]
<svg>...</svg>

### [Icon Name] - Variation B: [Brief Description]
<svg>...</svg>

### [Icon Name] - Variation C: [Brief Description]
<svg>...</svg>

### [Icon Name] - Variation D: [Brief Description]
<svg>...</svg>

### [Icon Name] - Variation E: [Brief Description]
<svg>...</svg>
```

**Total Output**: 11 icon types × 5 variations each = **55 SVG icons**

## Examples of Good vs. Bad

### ❌ Bad Book Icon
- Single page with text lines (looks like a document, not a book)
- No visible spine or thickness
- Too abstract or symbolic

### ✅ Good Book Icon

- Multiple page edges visible on right side
- Bookmark ribbon or decorative cover detail
- Immediately recognizable as a book

### ❌ Bad Movie Camera Icon
- Looks like a still photography camera (DSLR/point-and-shoot shape)
- No film reels visible
- Could be confused with photo camera

### ✅ Good Movie Camera Icon
- Film reels prominently visible (side-mounted or top-mounted)
- Hand crank or clapperboard to establish motion picture context
- Vintage cinema camera profile (boxy, mechanical)
- Unmistakably a movie camera

## Color Distribution Strategy

To create visual variety across the 55 icons while maintaining cohesion:

- Use **Dusty Pink** in 15-20 icons
- Use **Pale Peach** in 15-20 icons
- Use **Sage Green** in 12-15 icons
- Use **Dusty Coral** in 10-15 icons
- Use **Mid-Blue** in 10-12 icons
- Use **Bottle Green** in 8-10 icons
- Use **Muted Red** in 6-8 icons
- Use **Warm Taupe** in 8-10 icons
- Use **Dark Brown** for outlines/strokes in most icons
- Use **Cream** for highlights/fills in many icons

**Goal**: Every icon should feel like it belongs to the same family, but the palette should be fully utilized across the entire library.

---

## Notes on Literalism

The user has emphasized that icons must be **immediately recognizable**. Avoid:
- Overly abstract symbols
- Ambiguous shapes that could represent multiple things
- Clever conceptual metaphors that require explanation

Favor:
- Literal representations of the object/concept
- Clear silhouettes and shapes
- Distinctive features that define the icon's subject
- Details that aid recognition (sprocket holes on film, spokes on reels, etc.)

**Test**: Show the icon to someone unfamiliar with the context. Can they name what it represents in under 2 seconds?

---

## Success Criteria

A successful icon library will:
1. Feel cohesively **Wes Anderson** (geometric, vintage, whimsical)
2. Use the **full color palette** strategically
3. Provide **5 genuinely distinct variations** for each icon type
4. Be **immediately recognizable** (pass the glance test)
5. Scale beautifully from 24px to 120px
6. Work harmoniously together when displayed as a collection

**Good luck! Create something delightfully Anderson-esque.** 🎬
